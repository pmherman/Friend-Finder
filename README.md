Deployed on Heroku at: https://morning-plains-43651.herokuapp.com/

Technologies used: Express, Body-Parser, Twitter Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery

# Description

This application will take a series of questions, average out the answer and based on the friends that have been loaded into the object on the server, select the closest match.

All questions must be answered in order for the application to execute correctly.

When a match is found, a modal will prompt with a photo and name of the match.

This application is a great example of using express and jQuery logic to execute a complex series of commands.
